# EyeGuard: Shoplifting Theft Detection System

EyeGuard is a computer vision-based system designed to detect shoplifting incidents in retail stores. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, EyeGuard automates the process of identifying suspicious behaviors in real-time, significantly reducing theft-related losses and improving store security.

## System Overview

### **Problem Statement**
Retail stores face billions of dollars in annual losses due to shoplifting. Traditional theft detection methods rely heavily on manual monitoring, which is prone to human error, time-consuming, and costly. EyeGuard bridges this gap by providing a scalable, automated solution capable of monitoring retail environments in real-time, accurately detecting shoplifting activities.

### **Objectives**
1. **Real-time Detection**: Monitor live video feeds and detect suspicious activities.
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify potential shoplifting behavior using predefined patterns.
3. **Alert System**: Notify store management or security personnel instantly.
4. **Data Logging**: Record incidents for post-analysis and audits.

### **Key Features**
- **Surveillance Footage Analysis**: Processes video streams to identify suspicious activities.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for theft detection.
- **Cost-Effective**: Designed to be affordable and scalable for retailers of all sizes.
- **Behavioral Context Awareness**: Differentiates between casual browsing and theft-related actions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy
- **Frameworks**: Keras, Flask (for integration with store systems)
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Live surveillance footage from cameras.
2. **Preprocessing**: Frames are processed using OpenCV for object tracking and behavioral analysis.
3. **Model Prediction**: CNNs analyze the behavior to detect patterns indicative of shoplifting.
4. **Alert System**: Sends real-time notifications to security personnel when suspicious activity is identified.

## System Limitations
1. May struggle with poor-quality video footage.
2. Requires customization for diverse store layouts.
3. Challenged by highly sophisticated shoplifting techniques.
